# Compendium

This is a light, simple and fast "hunter's notes" app I made to access essential information abount Monster Hunter World creatures, without having to navigate the in-game hunter's notes. It shows monsters weaknesses and restistances in a card grid format with quick search feature. Pretty handy for hunters like me who still don't know by heart what monsters are sensitive to.

I mostly use it when chain-hunting monsters in the Guiding Lands, to choose the appropriate weapon or loadout quickly.

The database was taken from Neryss' [monster_hunter_db](https://github.com/Neryss/monster_hunter_db), kudos to them. Some entries were still missing or incomplete, which I started to fix but there's still some work to be done. Some entries also seem to have incorrect information. I'll do my best to correct them as I go through.

The app is fully responsive. and can be accessed here :

Happy hunting !
